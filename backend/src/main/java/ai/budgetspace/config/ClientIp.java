/**
 * Sprint 10.168 — resolve the real client IP behind a known number of trusted reverse proxies, WITHOUT trusting
 * client-supplied X-Forwarded-For entries. Proxies append the address they received from, so with N trusted hops
 * the real client is the Nth entry from the right — the one OUR outermost proxy recorded. A bad actor can prepend
 * fake X-Forwarded-For values (e.g. to rotate "IPs" and dodge a per-IP limit or the per-guest AI cap), but cannot
 * forge the entry our own proxy appends. Falls back to the socket address when X-Forwarded-For is absent or shorter
 * than the hop count (direct/local requests, or a misconfigured count). Shared by RateLimitFilter + PlanController.
